### Project Plan
1. Source Jquery, `.js` and `.css` files to HTML. 
2. Add Input fields and the submitt button to HTLM for info needed to be collected.
3. Add table into HTML with info needed. 
4. Add a global array that holds all the objects for the employees. 
4. Make a function that adds "objects" to a table (What we did for the review).
5. Make a function for the submitt button. 
6. Make a function that adds up all the salarys.

### Prerequisites


### Installation
1. Open up the HTML file in your internet browser. 
2. This was created with using jquery and javascript. 


### Usage
1. Pull up the application. 
2. Once this is up and visable, the user should see Add Employee and under that are fields to add your employees information. 
3. Once all the correct information is entered for the employee, click the submit button. 
4. The submit button will enter the employees information into the table and will calculate the totaly monthly cost.
5. The total monthly cost takes the employees annual salary's and adds them up then divides them by 12. 
6. If the total monthly cost is more then $20,000 the totaly monthly cost with be in red.
7. There is also a delete button in the Employees table. This will allow the employees that were entered to be taken out of the employees table if needed or if something was enetered by mistake.
